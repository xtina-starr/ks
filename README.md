# Mini Kickstarter

KS is a command line app that mimics some of the simple functionality of Kickstarter. 

To use:  
Download or clone the refactor2 KS repository located here: https://github.com/xtina-starr/ks/tree/refactor2  

The app accepts four commands: project, back, list, and backer. The entry point of the app is the ks.rb file. To execute a command, navigate to the directory where the ks dir lives and in the command line enter any for the accepted commands with the appropriate parameters.
